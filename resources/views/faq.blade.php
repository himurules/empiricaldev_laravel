                                Custom home builders help make people’s dreams come alive. We work one-on-one with homebuyers to sub-contract and coordinate with an in-house team to build one-of-a-kind homes based on what the buyer envisions in their new home. Working with our custom home builders, you can take the dream home you have in your head and turn it into a real-life masterpiece.

                            <p>No, you don’t need a real estate agent when building a custom home. Most homebuyers who partner with our custom home builders don’t have a real estate agent. However, if you have one, we will compensate them for their services. Usually, most people find Empirical Custom Homes through referrals, a Parade of Homes, the Park City Showcase of Homes, or online.</p>

                            <p>Compensation for custom home builders typically depends on location. We are a cost + builder, meaning we follow a transparent pricing model. Our homebuyers see where every penny of what they are paying goes, including allowances and profitability. We find that removing any of the usual guesswork when building a custom home makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>

                            <p>The custom home building process starts by selecting a lot. The architect or designer will then create house plans to match project goals and square footage to the lot. You can partner with a custom home builder at any time during this process, but we usually get involved during design to ensure cohesiveness between all parties. If you don’t have a designer or architect, we can refer you to some of the best in the state. Inouye Design is one of our partners with years of experience working with us on many of our custom homes in the Promontory community of Park City. Inouye and other design teams aren’t in-house, but we know that their work meets our client’s high standards. We also welcome any architects or designers to the Empirical team!</p>

You will also need to account for design and plan approval time. Design usually takes 2-3 months, while city/county approval can take 4-8 weeks. Then, build time will take an average of 12-18 months.</p>
