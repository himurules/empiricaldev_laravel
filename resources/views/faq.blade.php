                                Our team is eager to collaborate with clients through key decision-making processes. During the
                                construction process, regular progress meetings will be scheduled to discuss updates, address
                                any concerns, and ensure that the construction aligns with your expectations.

                                each product and/or service. Should any issues arise during the building process that may lead
                                to variations in the overall cost, this is discussed in detail during weekly meetings with our
                                clients to ensure full transparency.

                                When it comes to the building process, the duration can vary for each unique project. We take
                                into account the specific requirements and complexities of each build. To ensure efficient
                                planning, we generate a Gantt Chart that outlines the construction timeline for each job. This
                                helps us stay organised and ensures that we can provide you with a more accurate timeframe.
                                It is important to note that unforeseen events can sometimes impact the expected timeline of a
                                construction project. These events could include things like weather conditions, supply chain
                                issues, or unexpected complications during the building process. While we do our best to
                                anticipate and mitigate these challenges, they may cause some adjustments to the initial
                                timeline.
